# Testing Graphs with Matplotlib

This repo is an exercise I am following along to try the matplotlib, numpy, and pandas libraries. 

I am using the Matplotlib Crash Course video by Keith Galli [found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xc3CA655Y4). 

## Running the Program

1. [Install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com)
   * Contains all necessary libraries
2. Clone the repo
3. In your command line, type `jupyter notebook`.
4. Once in Jupyter Notebook, navigate to cloned repo location.
5. Open `matplotlib-practice.ipynb`.
6. Run all lines in the notebook.
